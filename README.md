Hi there! This is the profile of The Gaia System (A tulpamancy System, meaning that there are multiple people in one body). Currently we are a system of two (one Host (Vincent) and one Tulpa (Lyfrit)), but it may extend in the future. We both like metal, although Lyfrit is more into electric stuff and Nerdcore. Here you will find any of our Projets, the hugest probably is TulpApp, an App made for other Plural Systems (mostly Tulpamancy Systems, as the name probably implies). If you find a bug, you can DM us at Twitter (@TheGaiaSystem) or reddit (u/GaiasSoul), or write us a mail at thegaiasystembugs@gmail.com!
