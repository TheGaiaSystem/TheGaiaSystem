# An introduction to this bag of weirdos

Hi there! This is the profile of The Gaia System (A tulpamancy System, meaning that there are multiple people in one body). Currently we are a system of three (Host, Lyfrit and Io), but it may extend in the future. We like metal, electrical music and nerdcore although there are of course some differences in the taste. Here you will find any of our Projets, but most of them are unfinished since we only work on them if we have the motivation to do it. If you find a bug or security issue, you can DM us at Twitter (@TheGaiaSystem) or reddit (u/GaiasSoul), or write us a mail at thegaiasystembugs@gmail.com!
