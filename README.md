Hi there! This is the profile of The Gaia System (A tulpamancy System, meaning that there are multiple people in one body). Currently we are a system of three (Host, Lyfrit and Io), but it may extend in the future. We like metal, electrical music and nerdcore although there are of course some differences in the taste. Here you will find any of our Projets, the hugest probably is TulpApp, an App made for other Plural Systems (mostly Tulpamancy Systems, as the name probably implies). If you find a bug, you can DM us at Twitter (@TheGaiaSystem) or reddit (u/GaiasSoul), or write us a mail at thegaiasystembugs@gmail.com!
